Case 2: You forget to update package-lock.json
If you only edit package.json (manually or by mistake),
npm ci will fail because package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync.
That’s by design → ensures deterministic installs.
✅ Fix: Always run npm install (locally) after adding/removing packages so package-lock.json stays updated.
